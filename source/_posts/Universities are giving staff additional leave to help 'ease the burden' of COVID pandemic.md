Andrew Timming is making the most of his additional "well-being" leave by doing "basically nothing" in locked-down Melbourne, the RMIT university professor says.

"It's the best thing I have done for a long time," he said.

"People do need to detach and step away, even if stepping away doesn't mean stepping away from your home."

"RMIT's global community has made an extraordinary contribution this year, continuing to work, teach and research despite the circumstances we face and the demands in our lives due to the pandemic," said interim vice-chancellor and president Dionne Higgins.

    "Providing five days of well-being leave gives our people a chance to step away from work, take a well-deserved break and recharge."

To make it easier for staff to switch off, RMIT declared a "slow down week" from August 30 to September 3 while students are on mid-semester break.

Many staff have taken leave, while those still at work have cancelled non-essential meetings.
Pandemic leave will pay itself back

As an expert in human resource management, Professor Timming said giving staff additional paid leave during the pandemic was not altruistic but a smart investment.

"Employers were realising that the possibility of widespread burnout was real, and they needed to do something to mitigate that, especially with the lockdowns â€” it was at the point of reaching a crisis."
